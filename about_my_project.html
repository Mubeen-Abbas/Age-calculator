              Iâ€™m excited to introduce my latest project: an Age Calculator
              website! This user-friendly tool allows visitors to quickly
              determine their age based on their birthdate. With a sleek and
              intuitive design, the website makes it simple to input your
              birthdate and instantly get your age in years, months, and days.
              Whether you're tracking your age for personal milestones or need
              to calculate age for various applications, this website is
              designed to provide accurate and immediate results. I hope you
              find it both useful and easy to navigate This is a project made
              by<b> Mubeen Abbas Meghani</b>. The project is a website of age
              calculator . This was made by Mubeen Abbas with help of his
              friends Hasnain, Abdul rehman and Mohammed Ali Unia. Our computer
              teacher Aasim sir guided us for this â€¼ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</i
